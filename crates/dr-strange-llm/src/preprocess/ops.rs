//! Where an ops reader's facts land: a plane of their own, `<name>_ops`.
//!
//! The Compose, Kubernetes and Terraform readers are routed by the ordinary
//! digest — a compose file by its name, a `.tf` by its extension — so their
//! facts arrive mixed in with the code's. They do not belong there. A workload
//! and a function answer different questions, and a chart changes on a
//! different cadence from the code it deploys, so re-reading one must not
//! invalidate the other (`arch/10-ops.md` §2).
//!
//! Nothing has to ask for this. An ops file that is in the tree is read
//! because it is there, and the split is made on the one thing every fact
//! already carries: the plugin that produced it.
